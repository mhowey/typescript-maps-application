   * ! Note about this constructor style:
   * This odd-looking syntax accomplishes a couple of things. It's the class's
   * constructor function that is showing that it receives a collection array of
   * numbers in it's signature,
   *
   * BUT!! -> it ALSO initializes the "collection" property without having it
   * setup outside the constructor and then initialized inside the constructor
   * function for each property, in this case - JUST "collection", an array of numbers.
   * Therefore, though somewhat less obvious as the traditional syntax
   * of setting up your properties that need to be passed in to the constructor
   * as an argument and then assigning each one using 'this.[argument] = [property_name]'
   * we can just get it all done in one line. Arguably to me, this is a
   * way to make your code more explicit, AS LONG AS THE ENGINEER UNDERSTANDS
   * and can "grock" this method of setting up class properties that are passed in.
   *
   * So perhaps in a project with more junior devs you would use the more verbose
   * pattern of setup then assignment in the constructor syntax because this
   * syntax is less obvious, though I think the public keyword in the signature
   * of the constructor kind of gives this one away...
